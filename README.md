# Project 5 : nina-carducci

## About this project
This project is part of the OpenClassrooms web developer path :rocket:.

This project aims to optimize and debug a website. Several errors are hidden in the JavaScript code and need to be fixed. The application's performance must be improved.

Main optimizations are:
* Images need to be optimized
* Semantics must be modified
* Page loading must be accelerated
* Many tags are missing and/or incorrectly filled in
* And others optimizations

:white_check_mark:The goal is to achieve a minimum score of 90% with the [Lighthouse](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk) performance monitoring tool.

:white_check_mark:The website must comply with the minimum accessibility rules defined by the WCAG ([Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/docs/)).

:white_check_mark:The development must adhere to best practices.

:white_check_mark:SEO should also be above 90%.
